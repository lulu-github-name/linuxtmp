# This CI will only work for trusted contributors. CI for public contributors
# runs via a webhook on the merge requests. There's nothing you have to do if
# you want your changes tested -- created pipelines will be automatically
# linked in the merge request and appropriate labels will be added to it.
# Changes to this file will NOT be reflected in the testing.
